Had a chance to take a walk in a local market area near the Peace harbour (太平码头) on Tuesday, after a short afternoon tour of the Gulang Island (鼓浪屿) opposite the harbour. Strolling along the old market streets (which looks like the '80s in Singapore, with similar warmth and humidity), come across this interesting building (among many others). It must be one of the most patched buildings I have seen so far in so many cities that I have visited in China and around the world.
