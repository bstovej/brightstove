<div id="msgcns!9091E2A0F1B7D523!659" class="bvMsg"><div>Windows Live has recently released publicly a new Beta version of an online searchable map of China. See <a href="http://ditu.live.com">http://ditu.live.com</a>, which is 地图@live.com. This should help those who are visiting places in China to get a better orientation and also locate places using Chinese road names, restaurant names, etc. I personally used this a lot when it was still an internal Beta. Now that it is publicly available, it is even more convenient to check out places with my Windows Mobile device while on the road. </div></div>
