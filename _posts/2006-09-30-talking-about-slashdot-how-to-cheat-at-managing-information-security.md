<div id="msgcns!9091E2A0F1B7D523!370" class="bvMsg"><p>Just come across this entry in Slashdot, about a book on managing information security in a corporate environment. What's revealed in the review, and also many comments that are posted are interesting. They remind me of my life in a multi-nationals bank previously.
