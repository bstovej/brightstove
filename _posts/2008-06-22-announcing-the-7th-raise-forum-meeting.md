<div id="msgcns!9091E2A0F1B7D523!696" class="bvMsg"><p>In my <a href="http://eussion.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!9091E2A0F1B7D523!677.entry" target="_blank">previous updates</a> on the completion of the 6th RAISS Forum Meeting proceedings, I promised further updates, but I keep forgetting about it. Finally, through a conversation with a friend today, I got reminded that this needs to be provided soonest. So, here it goes. 
<p>The 7th RAISE Forum meeting will be held from July 17 to 18, 2008 at Hotel Istana, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. With the dedicated attention and follow-up by the Secretariat (Rafidah Abdul Hamid of Cybersecurity Malaysia), we have now developed a comprehensive agenda for the two days meeting. Day one will focus on the country updates from participating economies, while day two will focus on understanding and providing input to the various developing standards from ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 WG 1 and WG 4, as well as discussion on a number of emerging security requirements. The latter includes topics such as Traceback and Trusted Networking, and Incident and Security Information Sharing. Details of the <a href="http://www.itsc.org.sg/7thmtg.html" target="_blank">meeting agenda</a> and <a href="http://cid-9091e2a0f1b7d523.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Public/7th RAISE|_registration form.doc" target="_blank">registration information </a>can be downloaded from my SkyDrive public folder (follow the links provided.)
