<div id="msgcns!9091E2A0F1B7D523!107" class="bvMsg"><p><span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Tahoma;">In CNA news channel in the morning of Oct 15, there's a documentary on the impact of terrorism in S.E. Asia to foreigners living and working in this region, especially in places like Indonesia and Thailand. One US person interviewed by CNA in Bangkok said that because of such issue, he has been receiving many travel advisories on the risks of visiting these locations. The message has also been consistently - 'stay vigilant'. To him, when the same message has been received so many times, its meaning is becoming less and less significant. </span>
<p><span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Tahoma;"></span><span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Tahoma;">This is the direct opposite of what the sender intended. From a psychological perspective, is this a common outcome? What can we do to prevent such outcome?</span> </div>
