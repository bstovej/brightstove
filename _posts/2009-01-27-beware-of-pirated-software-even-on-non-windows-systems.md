<div id="msgcns!9091E2A0F1B7D523!850" class="bvMsg"><div>In an earlier entry, I blogged about <a href="http://eussion.spaces.live.com/default.aspx?_c01_BlogPart=blogentry&amp;_c=BlogPart&amp;handle=cns!9091E2A0F1B7D523!759">how users of non-geniune software secure their systems</a>, and mentioned about IDC's analyst reporting the link between malicious/trojan software and non-geniune software. It seems that the connection is becoming stronger ever, and has grown beyond the Windows platform. </div>

<div>According to Computerworld, &quot;<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9126609&amp;intsrc=hm_list" target="_blank">Trojan hides in pirated copies of Apple iWork '09</a>&quot; as well. As such, any software that can be exploited will be exploited.  Be aware, or beware.</div>
