<div id="msgcns!9091E2A0F1B7D523!661" class="bvMsg"><div>I was in Hongkong before the Lunar New Year and read from the press about a <a href="http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/177704,hong-kong-boy-14-arrested-for-hacking-into-school-computers.html" target="_blank">14 years old teenager who was arrested for hacking into a school network</a>. As a result, several other media picked up the story and shortly after, my colleague and I were interviewed to comment about the security issues on the Internet, in particular, relating to the community networks, chats, etc, that Web 2.0 has offered today. </div>

Recently, my colleagues just sent through some updated URLs, which I think are useful links that worth sharing further. Here they are: </div>
