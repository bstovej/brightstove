As in many other places, trust in people is also a diminishing thing. From the store fronts in the city, to car parks in national parks and various sight seeing places, to honey stall along the country motorways, there were a variety of warning signs helping to keep us all out of troubles. The irony, or may be the motivation of all this, vandalism, remain unattended in national parks (see photo below), now becoming a human addition to the scenic view of the country.</div>

Whether there's a lack of actions, or responsive counter-actions, is uncertain as a passer by observing. In any case, mere warning and messaging will certainly add to the burdens of the already disciplined ones, not changing the behaviors of the perpetrators.</div>
