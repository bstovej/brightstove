<div id="msgcns!9091E2A0F1B7D523!651" class="bvMsg"><p>I was reviewing some of the photographs that I have taken in the past months during the many trips I had abroad and within China, and found one (below) amongst the collection, which reminded me about the visit I had in Taipei in October 2007. In the two weeks that I was there, the news media were reporting on issues involving one Minister digging his nose (being caught on camera, live in TV broadcast), and others commenting on a phrase used by an opposition candidate, Ma YinJiu, that the problem in Taiwan was essentially &quot;economic, stupid!&quot;, taking the phrase from a speech by former US President Bill Clinton previously. Other politicians followed with &quot;stupid!&quot; ending in their speeches essentially that week during most of the debates. It was hard to dissect what they were really focusing and debating as issues. Taipei city was in autumn and calm otherwise. The picture below seems to depict the situation.

<p>The picture was taken at the entrance to a pool, but not sure what kind of pool it was though. At first glance, it presents calmness, and quietness. The signboard didn't really state what it was, neither was there other labels around the area to give further clues. On the left, the warning sign depicts a stroke crossing over a palm above water. Does this sign means no waving above the water, or no sinking allowed in the pool? It probably try to signal no swimming, but there wasn't any drawing of a swimmer or something related. The writing on the notice below didn't state anything about swimming as well. The notice board below states in Chinese 危险！水深危险，严禁入池, which has the English phrases &quot;Danger!&quot;, and &quot;Restricted Pool&quot; as well. Here, the Chinese phrase and English translation differs. What the Chinese phrase states is that the pool is deep and dangerous, entrance to the pool is not allowed (prohibited), not merely a restricted pool.  
<p>On the right side of this signboard sits two statues of a sleeping monk (there's another one on the other side of the entrance that is not captured in this picture). The two statues provide calm to the situation, but what do they really mean? Again, quite clueless. Does it means that one should sleep rather than visit the pool? Or does it means that even though there's the warning sign, people may disobey and enter the pool; they would rather rest and sleep than to really prohibit? Or does it means that even if they place two human guards at the entrance, they would likely sleep there than doing their duties; perhaps having two statues of sleeping monks there would achieve the same, with less or no maintenance cost involved? Nevertheless, taken as a whole, it seems to reflect a state of calmness hazard, like what's happening in the city at that moment. </div>
