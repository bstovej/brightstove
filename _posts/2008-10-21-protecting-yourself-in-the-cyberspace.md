<div id="msgcns!9091E2A0F1B7D523!753" class="bvMsg"><div>A while back, I blogged about some findings on <a href="http://eussion.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!9091E2A0F1B7D523!707.entry" target="_blank">users' experiences </a>of security breaches. This morning, just come across this new site, known as <a href="http://securitygarden.blogspot.com/2008/10/cyber-security-awareness-tip-of-day_17.html" target="_blank">Security Garden</a>, that is providing &quot;Tip of the Day&quot; to help users protect themselves when using the Internet, in particular, when using applications such as Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, Windows Live Spaces, etc. The site is RSS enabled, so you could subscribe it to your home page to get the latest tips each day. </div>

<div>On another note, <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=2042" target="_blank">ZDNet reported </a>yesterday that &quot;A team of Swiss researchers say there are several ways to recover keystrokes from wired keyboards by simply measuring the electromagnetic radiations emitted when keys are pressed&quot;. Not sure what they are trying to prove. Commercialization of tempest technology? Perhaps together with the Green movement, this could signal the possible rise of a mechanical keyboard--or the re-incarnation of the typewriter, just like we have &quot;unplugged&quot; music nowadays. </div></div>
