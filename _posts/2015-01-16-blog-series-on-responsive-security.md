I have recently published a five parts series on the captioned topic, based on <a title="Responsive Security – Be Ready to Be Secure" href="https://mengchow.wordpress.com/2013/10/15/responsive-security-be-ready-to-be-secure/" target="_blank">my book of the same title</a>, at Cisco's Security Blog site. For convenience of the readers of this blog, I have the links to the five parts consolidated here for quick access:
