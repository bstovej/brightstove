With the help of [Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/), I've finally migrated all my 20 over years of blogs from https://mengchow.wordpress.com/ to this new https://brightstove.net site. All done in less than three hours It could have been faster if I did not accidentally terminated Gemini's session while it was executing some of the work involved. Fortunately, the `/resume` command worked, and it was able to recover and continue with the plan till completion. 
The beauty with such AI coding tool like Gemini CLI is that it not only does the coding, but also develops the template and shell script required for writing and posting future blogs. All this creates a system that provides more space for focusing on the contents (outcomes) rather than the process.
