So the three new projects -- (1) ICT Readiness for Business Continuity; (2) Guidelines for Cybersecurity; and (3) Guidelines for Application Security -- are now on the development track. In addition to this, revision for the Network Security standard (ISO/IEC 18028) has also been approved through the balloting process.
