<div>Like all popular movies, they quickly become a series, with new twists to the original story, and also new casts of characters. Sometimes they turn out to be more interesting, other times, they just flop. I was in Hongkong in November 2007, and in one of the evenings, got on board this taxi that looks like an enhanced version of the <a href="http://eussion.spaces.live.com/default.aspx?_c01_BlogPart=blogentry&amp;_c=BlogPart&amp;handle=cns!9091E2A0F1B7D523!532" target="_blank">Taxi Communicator</a> that I blogged about after my August 2007 visit.</div>

<div>This time, I have a chance to take a picture inside the taxi to show the line up of phones and gadgets on the dashboard. The unfortunate thing is that it was rather dark in the cab and I didn't use a flash for the snapshot. This taxi has three mobile phones attached (rather than two), and more fancy things hanging all over. Looks like this is a trend thing for the taxi in Hongkong now.</div>
