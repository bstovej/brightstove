The 8th RAISE Forum meeting convened today at the Institute of System Science (ISS), National University of Singapore (NUS). We have 20+ delegates from Japan, Malaysia, P.R. China, Chinese Taipei, Singapore, and South Korea, participating and lined up to also speak at the two-day meeting. The morning session started with a review of some of the international development in security standards, in ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27, and also ITU-T Study Group 17. There are a number of new Working and Study Groups that have also been created at JTC 1 level to look into newer ICT standardization needs, in area such as Clouding Computing, Green ICT, Smart Grid, and Energy Efficiency Data Center. Some of these topics are also being looked into at ITU-T, in which there are now new recommendations relating to secure application services, and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) security being developed. The two groups, SC 27 and ITU-T SG17 have some overlapping works as well, but liaison coordination between the two groups have been ongoing. The Working Party Chairs and Rapporteurs at ITU-T SG17 are also participating actively at SC 27, which helps in these coordination efforts.

We just completed our morning break. What’s next, and this afternoon, will be updates from the various participating economies’ security standards experts on their respective information security landscape.
