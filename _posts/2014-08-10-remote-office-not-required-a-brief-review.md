<div>Working remotely is a practice that is familiar to many, especially in where I work today, so much so that we often take for granted its benefits, without even realizing their significance. I happened to come across this book recently, and enjoyed a new understanding and realization of what working remotely really has to offer, and how to make it work even better for us who often work from remote sites.</div></p>
<div></div>
<div>"<em>Remote - Office Not Required</em>", written by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, co-founders of 37Signals (recently has its name changed to Basecamp) is a highly successful company that developed the online project management tool, Basecamp. In "Remote", Fried and Heinemeier shared their philosophy of "free to live and work wherever you want". I found their articulation of the pros and cons, and how to deal with the cons while leveraging the pros refreshing. As such, I'm listing here what I have jotted down while going through the book; some of the key benefits, and suggestions on how to make remote work arrangement works effectively, both from the manager, and individuals' perspectives. If anyone is interested to get a copy, the book is available at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Remote-Office-Required-Jason-Fried/dp/0804137501" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a>.</div></p>
<div></div>
<div>Benefits of Remote Work arrangement:</div>
<ol>
	<li>Time saving
<ul>
	<li>Commute - 1 to 3 hours a day, depending on where you are, that's between 5 to 15 hours a week saving per employee</li>
	<li>Can work anywhere that you feel comfortable; don't need to stick to an office, or a home office</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Productivity improvement
<ul>
	<li>Less interruption than working in the office (interruption factory) - possible to get work done only before or after others have arrived or left</li>
	<li>Interruption disrupt flow and rhythm of work</li>
	<li>True productivity happens only with uninterrupted span of time is made available for quality work to be done</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Work-life Balance
<ul>
	<li>Improve quality of life of individuals</li>
	<li>Have time for your hobby, interest (don't need to wait for retirement) - music, biking, etc</li>
	<li>Have more time with family</li>
	<li>Improve employees' loyalty and satisfaction</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<div>For it to work effectively, managers need to change mindset:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Trust
<ul>
	<li>Employees are adults, don't treat them like children - respect them and trust them to do their best work in their career</li>
	<li>When people are respected and able to do their best work, they would stay with the organization</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Control
<ul>
	<li>Urge to have physical daily oversights</li>
	<li>Shift to ensure people are working on meaningful work rather than seems working on something</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Meetings
<ul>
	<li>Meetings can be toxic and disruptive to productive work</li>
	<li>An hour meeting involving five people is 5 hours of productive work loss.</li>
	<li>Use email and IM in productive ways to replace need for meetings</li>
	<li>Involve least number of people in a meeting wherever possible (a short chat will be more productive)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Office
<ul>
	<li>Should be like the library, a place to learn and focus</li>
	<li>Create separate private space for collaborative discussions</li>
	<li>If you are going to have an office, it has to be inspirational - this is not possible for everyone; Remote gives people option to choose where they can be most comfortable to get the most done</li>
	<li>Implement a "no-talk day" (NTD) in the office - tremendous amount of work can be done when there's no interruption for a day; this would make the office a productive place, a go-to place when need to get things done (on the NTD).</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Respect peoples space
<ul>
	<li>Slow down to get more - use the email or other communication tool effectively. Again, use of collaborative workspace such as WebEx Social allows one to read, comments, feedback, and updates project status at their own convenient time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div>Some other important considerations:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Time zone overlap - 4 to 5 hours overlap the best.</li>
	<li>Great for creative and knowledge works</li>
</ul>
<div>Face to face and social connection are still important - organize regular gatherings and offsites for such connections to get everyone closer will be more meaningful.</div>
<div></div></p>
<div>In addition to the book, I have found a number of Youtube videos, which Fried and Heinemeier shared some of their thoughts. Those videos should come in handy if you don't have time to read the book:</div>
