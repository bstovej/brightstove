<div id="msgcns!9091E2A0F1B7D523!656" class="bvMsg"><p>While the <a href="http://eussion.spaces.live.com/default.aspx?_c01_BlogPart=blogentry&amp;_c=BlogPart&amp;handle=cns!9091E2A0F1B7D523!532" target="_blank">taxi drivers in Hongkong</a> are technologically geared to receive more calls and communicate better to improve their livelihood, those in the Taipei city are taking a different approach, in the form of &quot;application diversification&quot; perhaps. During my visit to Taipei in October 2007, I started to find numerous taxi having the back of the front seats used as a platform for displaying accessories and other small items for sales to the passengers sitting behind.

<p>The experience, as a passenger, was interesting, or rather, refreshing. I would rarely look at these women's accessories on the streets, unless my wife or daughter wanted my opinion for what they are looking. In the taxi, I have the closest, non-interference encounter with these kinds of stuff. I think women passengers (young or elder alike) should be fascinated with such experience, especially when there's a traffic jam on the way to shopping. A taxi no longer just takes you from point A to point B. It has other applications add-on now. This is also a major change from being a passive platform using radio, TV, or printed advertisements at the back to evangelize something or market a product or service. It is retail on the move.</p></div>
