# About

An information security practitioner's observations and reflections, mostly made while on the road, including reports from various security conferences and standards meetings. At time, simply rants on things observed, or just a quick note. If you like to get in touch, drop me a note at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meng-chow-kang-92b9b18/).

### Privacy & Tracking Disclosure

To better understand which topics resonate most with readers and to improve the site's content, I have implemented a lightweight visitor tracking system (**Umami Analytics**). 

In keeping with the spirit of an information security blog, this implementation prioritizes your privacy:
- **No Personal Data:** The tracker does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII). Your IP address is anonymized, and no private data is captured.
- **No Tracking Cookies:** This site does not use cookies to track individual user activities across the web or to identify you personally.
- **Aggregated Stats Only:** Tracking is limited to aggregated metrics such as page visit counts, general geographic location (country level), and referral sources.
- **Purpose:** These statistics are used solely for internal performance monitoring to help me understand reach and engagement across various topics.
